In this document, you'll learn how to update different details of a cart.

<Note>

All cart updates are performed using the [Update Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcartsid).

</Note>

## Update Cart's Region

If a customer changes their region, you must update their cart to be associated with that region.

For example:

export const updateRegionHighlights = [
  ["11", `"new_id"`, "Pass the new chosen region's ID."]
]

```ts highlights={updateRegionHighlights}
fetch(`http://localhost:9000/store/carts/${cartId}`, {
  credentials: "include",
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    headers: {
      "x-publishable-api-key": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY || "temp",
    },
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    region_id: "new_id",
  }),
})
.then((res) => res.json())
.then(({ cart }) => {
  // use cart...
  console.log(cart)
})
```

The Update Cart API route accepts a `region_id` request body parameter, whose value is the new region to associate with the cart.

## Set Cart's Customer

You might need to change the cart's customer in two cases:

- You created the cart for the customer as a guest, then they logged-in, so you want to associate the cart with them as a registered customer.
- You're transfering the cart from one customer to another, which is useful in company setups, such as when implementing B2B commerce applicatons.

To set or change the cart's customer, send an authenticated `POST` request to the Set Cart's Customer API route:

<Note>

This API route is only available after [Medusa v2.0.5](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.0.5).

</Note>

```ts
fetch(`http://localhost:9000/store/carts/${cartId}/customer`, {
  credentials: "include",
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-publishable-api-key": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY || "temp",
  },
})
.then((res) => res.json())
.then(({ cart }) => {
  // use cart...
  console.log(cart)
})
```

To send an authenticated request, either use `credentials: include` if the customer is already authenticated with a cookie session, or pass the Authorization Bearer token in the request's header.

<Note title="Tip">

Learn more about authenticating customers in [this guide](../../customers/login/page.mdx).

</Note>

The cart is now associated with the logged-in customer.
