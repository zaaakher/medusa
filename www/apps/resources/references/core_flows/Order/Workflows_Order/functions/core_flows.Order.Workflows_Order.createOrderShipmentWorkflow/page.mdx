# createOrderShipmentWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `createOrderShipmentWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow creates a shipment for an order. It's used by the [Create Order Shipment Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders\_postordersidfulfillmentsfulfillment\_idshipments).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the created shipment. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that 
allows you to create custom data models linked to the shipment.

You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around creating a shipment.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### shipmentCreated

This hook is executed after the shipment is created. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the created shipment.

#### Example

```ts
import { createOrderShipmentWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

createOrderShipmentWorkflow.hooks.shipmentCreated(
  (async ({ shipment, additional_data }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.
