# cancelOrderFulfillmentWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `cancelOrderFulfillmentWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow cancels an order's fulfillment. It's used by the [Cancel Order's Fulfillment Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders\_postordersidfulfillmentsfulfillment\_idcancel).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the canceled fulfillment. For example, you can pass under `additional_data` custom data that 
allows you to update custom data models linked to the fulfillment.

You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around canceling a fulfillment.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

  })
)
```
