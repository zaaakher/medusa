# transferCartCustomerWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `transferCartCustomerWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow transfers a cart's customer ownership to another customer. It's useful if a customer logs in after
adding the items to their cart, allowing you to transfer the cart's ownership to the logged-in customer. This workflow is used
by the [Set Cart's Customer Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts\_postcartsidcustomer).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to set the cart's customer within your custom flows.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.
