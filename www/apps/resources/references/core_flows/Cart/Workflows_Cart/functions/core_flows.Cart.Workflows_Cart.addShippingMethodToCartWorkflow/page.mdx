# addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow adds a shipping method to a cart. It's executed by the 
[Add Shipping Method Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts\_postcartsidshippingmethods).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around adding a shipping method to the cart.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.
