# refreshPaymentCollectionForCartWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `refreshPaymentCollectionForCartWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow refreshes a cart's payment collection, which is useful once the cart is created or when its details
are updated. If the cart's total changes to the amount in its payment collection, the payment collection's payment sessions are 
deleted. It also syncs the payment collection's amount, currency code, and other details with the details in the cart.

This workflow is used by other cart-related workflows, such as the [refreshCartItemsWorkflow](../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart.refreshCartItemsWorkflow/page.mdx) to refresh the cart's
payment collection after an update.

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to refresh the cart's payment collection after making updates to it in your
custom flows.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

addShippingMethodToCartWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.
