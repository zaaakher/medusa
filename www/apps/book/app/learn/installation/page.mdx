In this chapter, you'll learn how to install and run a Medusa application.

## Create Medusa Application

A Medusa application is made up of a Node.js server and an admin dashboard. You can optionally install a separate [Next.js storefront](../storefront-development/nextjs-starter/page.mdx) either while installing the Medusa application or at a later point.

  }
]} />

To create a Medusa application, use the `create-medusa-app` command:

```bash
npx create-medusa-app@latest my-medusa-store
```

Where `my-medusa-store` is the name of the project's directory and PostgreSQL database created for the project. When you run the command, you'll be asked whether you want to install the Next.js storefront.

After answering the prompts, the command installs the Medusa application in a directory with your project name, and sets up a PostgreSQL database that the application connects to.

If you chose to install the storefront with the Medusa application, the storefront is installed in a separate directory named `{project-name}-storefront`.

### Successful Installation Result

Once the installation finishes successfully, the Medusa application will run at `http://localhost:9000`.

The Medusa Admin dashboard also runs at `http://localhost:9000/app`. The installation process opens the Medusa Admin dashboard in your default browser to create a user. You can later log in with that user.

If you also installed the Next.js storefront, it'll be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

You can stop the servers for the Medusa application and Next.js storefront by exiting the installation command. To run the server for the Medusa application again, refer to [this section](#run-medusa-application-in-development).

### Troubleshooting Installation Errors

If you ran into an error during your installation, refer to the following troubleshooting guides for help:

1. [create-medusa-app troubleshooting guides](!resources!/troubleshooting/create-medusa-app-errors).
2. [CORS errors](!resources!/troubleshooting/cors-errors).
3. [All troubleshooting guides](!resources!/troubleshooting).

If you can't find your error reported anywhere, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/new/choose).

## Run Medusa Application in Development

To run the Medusa application in development, change to your application's directory and run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

This runs your Medusa application at `http://localhost:9000`, and the Medusa Admin dashboard `http://localhost:9000/app`.

<Note title="Tip">

For details on starting and configuring the Next.js storefront, refer to [this documentation](../storefront-development/nextjs-starter/page.mdx).

</Note>

The application will restart if you make any changes to code under the `src` directory, except for admin customizations which are hot reloaded, providing you with a seamless developer experience without having to refresh your browser to see the changes.

## Create Medusa Admin User

Aside from creating an admin user in the admin dashboard, you can create a user with Medusa's CLI tool.

Run the following command in your Medusa application's directory to create a new admin user:

```bash
npx medusa user -e admin@medusajs.com -p supersecret
```

Replace `admin@medusajs.com` and `supersecret` with the user's email and password respectively.

You can then use the user's credentials to log into the Medusa Admin application.

---

## Update Medusa Application

New Medusa updates are posted in the [GitHub repository's releases](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases). You can also find the latest version at the top navigation of the documentation, and you can click on it to view the release notes of the latest version.

To update your Medusa application, bump the version of all `@medusajs/*` dependencies in your `package.json`. Then, re-install dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run install
```

## Project Files

Your Medusa application's project will have the following files and directories:

![A diagram of the directories overview](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1732803813/Medusa%20Book/medusa-dir-overview_v7ks0j.jpg)

### src

This directory is the central place for your custom development. It includes the following sub-directories:

- `admin`: Holds your admin dashboard's custom [widgets](../fundamentals/admin/widgets/page.mdx) and [UI routes](../fundamentals/admin/ui-routes/page.mdx).
- `api`: Holds your custom [API routes](../fundamentals/api-routes/page.mdx) that are added as endpoints in your Medusa application.
- `jobs`: Holds your [scheduled jobs](../fundamentals/scheduled-jobs/page.mdx) that run at a specified interval during your Medusa application's runtime.
- `links`: Holds you [module links](../fundamentals/module-links/page.mdx) that build associations between data models of different modules.
- `modules`: Holds your custom [modules](../fundamentals/modules/page.mdx) that implement custom business logic.
- `scripts`: Holds your custom [scripts](../fundamentals/custom-cli-scripts/page.mdx) to be executed using Medusa's CLI tool.
- `subscribers`: Holds your [event listeners](../fundamentals/events-and-subscribers/page.mdx) that are executed asynchronously whenever an event is emitted.
- `workflows`: Holds your custom [flows](../fundamentals/workflows/page.mdx) that can be executed from anywhere in your application.

### medusa-config.ts

This file holds your [Medusa configurations](!resources!/references/medusa-config), such as your PostgreSQL database configurations.

## Configure Medusa Application

By default, your Medusa application is equipped with the basic configuration to start your development.

If you run into issues with configurations, such as CORS configurations, or need to make changes to the default configuration, refer to [this guide on all available configurations](!resources!/references/medusa-config).

## Next Steps

In the next chapters, you'll learn about the architecture of your Medusa application, then learn how to customize your application to build custom features.
